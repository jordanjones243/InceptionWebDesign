    <h2>What is the Microsoft GreenerAI Project?</h2>
    <p> Microsoft has become a corporate leader in environmental sustainability by constantly striving to minimize the environmental footprint of its business operations while maximizing the positive environmental impacts of its products, policies and partnerships. As the environmental challenges facing the world grow, so too has Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring that the company’s activities are in-line with the best available science and the expectations of leading stakeholder communities. </p>
    <p>The Azure Machine Learning team is launching a project related to GreenAI . This project will establish a cost/carbon accounting capability within AzureML, and help inform a standard model for cost and carbon telemetry across Azure. As part of a cross-functional team, you’ll need to create & wrangle diverse data into production pipelines. You’ll use this to build telemetry, dashboards, and communicate your results across business groups. While you’ll be embedded within the Azure Machine Learning team, you’ll also be paired with mentors within the broader Microsoft sustainability community (Azure/MSR/Windows). You’ll also likely be contributing to open-source carbon measurement tooling on GitHub. </p>
