    <h2>Team Members</h2>
    <p>Shihan Xu - I'm a PhC in Bioengineering. My career goal is being a data scientist and I love challenges.</p>
    <p>Drew Forman - I am a one-year Master’s of Science student studying Information Management with a focus in Business Intelligence at the University of Washington. I got my Bachelor’s of Science in Applied Physics at the University of Washington as well. I have done previous projects around database creation for coffee production, and a research study around the effectiveness of light rail at easing rush hour traffic in the Puget Sound region. After I finish my studies, I hope to work for a company which is data-driven, understands it’s responsibility to the environment, and pushes the bounds on what can be accomplished through technology.</p>
    <p>Peter Carlson - I was raised in Redmond, living in Minneapolis. Masters focuses include data science and business intelligence</p>
    <p>Amiya Renavikar - Hi, I'm Amiya! I'm a Masters student at UW studying Information Management, specializing in Business Intelligence & Data Science. My undergraduate degree is in Computer Science from NC State University. I am passionate about AI-powered Business Intelligence and using AI to query large data sets and derive powerful insights through visualizations & language. Specifically, I am interested in Augmented Analytics, that uses machine learning and AI to assist with data preparation and insight generation for businesses. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, painting and dancing. I am also fascinated by languages! You can find me learning new languages on the Duolingo app (I have been learning Spanish & French during the pandemic).</p>
    <p>Andrew Wong - Hello! I'm Andrew, a rising senior majoring in Informatics at the University of Washington. For a bit about myself, I'm interested in ML applications, the cloud, and databases. Post graduation, I plan to pursue a career in software engineering. I'm honored to have had the opportunity to work as part of the GreenAI Team and look forward to seeing what the future holds!</p>
    <p>Ji-Hoon Kang - I graduated with a B.S in Computer Science & Software Engineering in 2020, then enrolled in the M.S Information Management program at the University of Washington iSchool to gain specializations in Data Science & Business Intelligence where I'm now entering my final year. Having prior experience in Cloud Computing & a newfound interest in Machine Learning, I joined two GreenAI projects where I got form new connections with my teammates, as well as gain new skillsets in MLOps, Machine Learning, and the AzureML platform. Outside of academics and work, I love to spend time with my two dogs, bake, weight train, and play card/board games with friends!</p>
    <p>Yash Raj Sinha - Majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a Minor in Informatics. I am super passionate about Machine Learning and this project has been an amazing opportunity to explore applying it to sustainability. I will be joining Slalom Build as a Data Engineer post graduation!</p>
    <p>Jordan Jones - I am a fourth year student at the University of Washington. I am passionate about backend development and my goal is to become a Software Engineer after I graduate. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, video games, and watching a variety of sports.</p>
